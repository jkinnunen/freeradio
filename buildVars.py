	addon_description=_("""FreeRadio is an internet radio add-on for NVDA that provides seamless access to thousands of stations via the Radio Browser open directory. It features a fully accessible station browser with search, country filter, favourites management, and per-station audio profiles. Playback is handled by a prioritised backend chain (BASS, VLC, PotPlayer, Windows Media Player) with support for volume control, audio effects, output device selection, and simultaneous audio mirroring to a second device. Additional features include instant and scheduled recording, sleep and alarm timers, automatic ICY metadata announcements, Shazam-based music recognition, and a liked-songs log. All controls and shortcuts are designed for NVDA accessibility."""),

_BASS_CONFIG_HLS_DELAY: 3 → 8 seconds
CDN-backed HLS streams such as TRT produce segments every 6–8 seconds. A 3-second live delay fell within that window, causing buffer underruns and audio glitches during periods of slow CDN response (e.g. live sports broadcasts).
_monitor_loop stall counter now resets only on BASS_ACTIVE_PLAYING.
Previously any state other than STALLED/STOPPED — including PAUSED — would reset the counter, masking transient segment fetch delays and slowing down stall detection.
