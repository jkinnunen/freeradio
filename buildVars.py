	addon_description=_("""FreeRadio is an internet radio add-on for NVDA that provides seamless access to thousands of stations via the Radio Browser open directory. It features a fully accessible station browser with search, country filter, favourites management, and per-station audio profiles. Playback is handled by a prioritised backend chain (BASS, VLC, PotPlayer, Windows Media Player) with support for volume control, audio effects, output device selection, and simultaneous audio mirroring to a second device. Additional features include instant and scheduled recording, sleep and alarm timers, automatic ICY metadata announcements, Shazam-based music recognition, and a liked-songs log. All controls and shortcuts are designed for NVDA accessibility."""),

**Focus management after item removal**
- Favorites list: after deleting a station, focus and selection automatically move to the next item in the list. If the deleted station was the last one, focus moves to the previous item. If the list becomes empty, focus moves to the Play button.
- Liked Songs list: same behaviour — after removing a song, focus stays on the next item, or moves to the Refresh button if the list is empty.
**Delete key shortcut**
- Pressing `Delete` while a station is selected in the Favorites list now triggers the Delete Station button (equivalent to clicking it), provided the button is enabled.
- Pressing `Delete` while a song is selected in the Liked Songs list now triggers the Remove button, provided the button is enabled.
- In both cases the key has no effect when no valid item is selected or the corresponding button is disabled.
- Added a new "Mute notifications" checkbox to FreeRadio settings (unchecked by default).
- When enabled, NVDA no longer announces station changes, playback state changes (play, pause, stop), or recording events (started, stopped, finished).
- Error messages, favourites feedback, music recognition results, and update notifications are intentionally unaffected.
- Added an unassigned script_toggleMuteNotifications input gesture that toggles the setting on the fly. Assign a key combination via NVDA's Input Gestures dialog under the FreeRadio category.
- Two module-level helpers (_notify, _notify_on_demand) centralise the mute check, keeping call sites clean.
